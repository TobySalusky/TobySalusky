I'm Toby, a professional crust developer by day and a sleeping person by night!!

You might not be familiar with `crust`\~\~in fact, if you are familiar with it, you are probably me!!\~\~since `crust` is my own personal programming language.

Currently, my main focus is improving `crust`, such that I may one day get out of the abusive relationship I am engaged in with C++. While I do this, I am also writing a video editing program (lovingly dubbed `edit`), wherein I attempt to make a satisfying hybrid of UI-based and code-based editing & video creation approaches!

You will notice that neither `crust` nor `edit` are currently public on my github. This is intentional as I would like time to more fully flesh out their designs before anyone comes to expect anything too specific from them.
