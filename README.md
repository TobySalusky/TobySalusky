### Hi, I'm Toby! 👋
- I'm interested in Web Development 🌐, Computer Graphics 🎨, and Compilers/Programming Languages 🤓💻
- In my personal time, I like to build UI frameworks and creative tools that make my life easier. Check out:
  * [RAIUI](https://github.com/TobySalusky/raiui), a C++ fusion of immediate-mode and HTML/CSS style UI that lets you get the best of both
  * [MonoGameHtml](https://github.com/TobySalusky/MonoGameHtml), my approach to creating real-time/game interfaces in C# with React-like semantics
  * [SketchAround](https://github.com/TobySalusky/SketchAround), a C++/OpenGL 3D modelling suite that generates *(totally)* tubular meshes from 2D side-profiles and user-drawn functions
